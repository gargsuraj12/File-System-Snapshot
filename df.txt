Neil Matthew has been interested in and has programmed ccomputers since 1974. A mathematics graduate
from the University of Nottingham, Neil is just plain keen on programming languages and likes to explore
new ways of solving computing problems. He’s written systems to program in BCPL, FP (Functional
Programming), Lisp, Prolog, and a structured BASIC. He even wrote a 6502 microprocessor emulator to

$l around the world, corresponding almost exclusively over the Internet.
From an initial kernel that partially implemented a small subset of the UNIX
system service
run BBC microcomputer programs on UNIX systems.
In terms of UNIX experience, Neil has used almost every flavor since the late 1970s, including BSD
UNIX, AT&T System V, Sun Solaris, IBM AIX, many others, and of course Linux.
Neil can claim to have been using Linux since August 1993 when he acquired a floppy disk distribution

hacking C, C++, Icon, Prolog, Tcl, and Java at home and at work.
Most of Neil’s “home” projects were originally developed using SCO UNIX, but they’ve all ported to
Linux with little or no trouble. He says Linux is much easier because it supports quite a lot of features
from other systems, so that both BSD- and System V–targeted programs will generally compile with
little or no change.
As the head of software and principal engineer at Camtec Electronics in the 1980s, Neil programmed

new feature was networking: 1.0 included support for UNIX ’s
standard TCP/I
in C and C++ for real-time embedded systems. Since then he’s worked on software development tech-
niques and quality assurance. After a spell as a consultant with Scientific Generics he is currently work-
ing as a systems architect with Celesio AG.
